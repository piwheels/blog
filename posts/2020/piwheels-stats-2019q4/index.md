armv7l (Pi 2/3/4 platform) is still a majority architecture with over 90% usage, with armv6l (Pi
1/Zero) taking just 8.2%. The combined Arm architecture takes over 98% of all usage:

Python version usage changes more over time. Since Raspbian Buster was released, Python 3.7 usage
quickly overtook Python 3.5:

This was the busiest period for piwheels so far. We're now seeing 30k+ download days almost every
day, and kept up a 1 million downloads in a 30 day period for several weeks leading up to Christmas
day, where it dipped slightly. I'm sure we'll see a continuation of this in January. The new
record of 39k downloads in a single day shows we're likely to break to 40k mark before too long,
and if trends continue we might see this become a new regular daily number.
