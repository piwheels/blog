<p>In the period of January â€“ March 2020, <strong>3,317,443</strong> packages were downloaded from piwheels, bringing the total to <strong>18,062,971</strong>. This has saved nearly<strong> 60 years</strong> in the period, and <strong>232 years</strong> in total! This was in no small part to <em><a href="https://blog.piwheels.org/the-mysterious-case-of-the-unexplained-downloads-spike/">The mysterious case of the unexplained downloads spike</a></em> which turned out to be an upgrade pushed to <a href="https://octoprint.org/">octoprint</a> users.</p>
<p>Each month had around <strong>1.1 million</strong> downloads:</p>

<p>which saved around between <strong>17</strong> and <strong>22 years</strong> per month:</p>

<p><strong>March</strong> had the highest number of downloads ever with <strong>1,276,799</strong>. The highest day was <strong>5 March</strong> with a whopping <strong>60,324</strong>. This was the second day of the spike caused by octoprint. The next two weeks dropped steadily each day, but left regular daily downloads around 40k, which is 5-10k greater than usual. </p>

<p>The top 10 downloads were:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/pycparser">pycparser</a></strong> (147,532)</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/Flask-Login">Flask-Login</a></strong> (98,382) *</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy">numpy</a></strong> (83,633)</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/zope.component">zope.component</a></strong> (81,875)</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/PyYAML">PyYAML</a></strong> (75,123)</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/cffi">cffi</a></strong> (62,605)</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/opencv-python">opencv-python</a></strong> (52,953)</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/Markdown">Markdown</a></strong> (52,203) *</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/sentry-sdk">sentry-sdk</a></strong> (50,927) *</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/semantic-version">semantic-version</a></strong> (50,236) *</li></ol>
<p><em>* Note that Flask-Login, Markdown, sentry-sdk and semantic version are all dependencies of the octoprint project upgrade which caused the <a href="https://blog.piwheels.org/the-mysterious-case-of-the-unexplained-downloads-spike/">massive spike</a>.</em></p>
<p>In March alone, these four packages topped the bill, leaving pycparser trailing:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Flask-Login</strong> (94,457)</li><li><strong>Markdown</strong> (49,957)</li><li><strong>semantic-version</strong> (49,314)</li><li><strong>sentry-sdk</strong> (49,269)</li><li><strong>pycparser</strong> (32,167)</li></ol>
<p>It's still unexplained why Flask-Login got nearly double the downloads of the other two packages.</p>
<p>Raspbian still dominates usage with almost 95%:</p>

<p>armv7l (Pi 2/3/4 platform) is still a majority architecture with 89% usage, with armv6l (Pi 1/Zero) taking just 8%. The combined Arm architecture takes over 97% of all usage:</p>

<p>Python version usage changes more over time. Since Raspbian Buster was released, Python 3.7 usage quickly overtook Python 3.5:</p>

<p>Interestingly, there appears to have been a spike in usage of Python 2.7. However this is purely down to the octoprint upgrades. The four packages affected are universal Python wheels, so they work with 2 and 3.</p>

<p>This was the busiest period for piwheels so far. The month of March was by a long way the biggest month. We saw a spike which broke all previous records by far. It's been really interesting to see just one kind of Raspberry Pi use (octoprint) cause such a significant growth spurt.</p>
