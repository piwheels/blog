In the period of October â€” December 2020, **4,643,950** packages were downloaded from piwheels,
bringing the total to **30,815,907**. This has saved **55 years** in the period, and **439 years**
in total! There were **37,578,502** pip searches, **736,605** project page hits, **344,206** web
page hits and **50,894** project JSON downloads in the period.

**October** had the highest number of downloads (ever) with **1,850,781**:

Oddly, we experienced a one-day spike surpassing 100k downloads in a single day for the first time.
15 December saw a total of **105,826** downloads:

We just
[released](https://blog.piwheels.org/requires-python-support-new-project-page-layout-and-a-new-json-api/)
a new [JSON API](https://www.piwheels.org/json.html) a few days before the end of the previous
quarter, so for the first time, the top 10 project JSON downloads were:

1.  **[scipy](https://www.piwheels.org/project/scipy)** (324)
2.  **[numpy](https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy)** (108)
3.  **[opencv-python](https://www.piwheels.org/project/opencv-python)** (68)
4.  **[tensorflow](https://www.piwheels.org/project/tensorflow)** (58)
5.  **[imagecodecs](https://www.piwheels.org/project/imagecodecs)** (38)
6.  **[pycparser](https://www.piwheels.org/project/pycparser)** (36)
7.  **[future](https://www.piwheels.org/project/future)** (31)
8.  **[scikit-image](https://www.piwheels.org/project/scikit-image)** (31)
9.  **[opencv-contrib-python](https://www.piwheels.org/project/opencv-contrib-python)** (29)
10. **[urllib3](https://www.piwheels.org/project/urllib3)** (28)

The vast majority of JSON downloads are from browsers (or bots) and only a small proportion seem to
be from wget and requests.

## Platforms

Linux makes up 99.9% of all searches so I've discounted the rest. Raspbian / Raspberry Pi OS and
Debian are now combined (due to Raspberry Pi OS identifying itself as Debian). This group obviously
dominates with over 98%. Ubuntu remains in third place with under 1%, although we don't officially
support it.

<figure class="aligncenter size-large">
<img src="images/distro-usage-1.png" />
</figure>

Buster accounts for 85% of Raspbian/Debian usage, Stretch accounts for 15% and there's practically
no Jessie usage:

<figure class="aligncenter size-large">
<img src="images/debian-usage.png" />
</figure>

armv7l (Pi 2/3/4 platform) is still a majority architecture with 91% of searches from Arm devices,
with armv6l (Pi 1/Zero) taking under 5%. Raspberry Pi released a beta of a 64-bit version of the
official OS earlier in the year, and that's starting to grow in usage. It's currently up to 4.2%,
and those users are currently not served by piwheels as we don't build aarch64 platform wheels.

<figure class="aligncenter size-large">
<img src="images/debian-arch.png" />
</figure>

Python 3 has a reasonable majority of usage, and 3.7 (the version provided by the current stable
distro) has the highest share with 63%. Python 2.7 comes second with 23%, followed by 3.5 (from
oldstable), 3.8 and 3.6. Fortunately, Python 3.4 (in Jessie, now EOL) has an insignificant usage,
but it's a shame there's still so much Python 2 usage.

We're also logging pip and setuptools versions:

<figure class="aligncenter size-large">
<img src="images/pip-vers.png" />
</figure>

Note that 18.1 is pre-installed in Buster, and 9.0.1 is pre-installed in Stretch. 20.1.1 is a
recently released version, so likely the most common for people who update their pip.

<figure class="aligncenter size-large">
<img src="images/setuptools-vers.png" />
</figure>

Similarly, setuptools 40.8.0 is what's pre-installed in Buster, but the version of pip in Stretch
doesn't send the setuptools version (33.1.1) in the user agent like it does in newer versions.
