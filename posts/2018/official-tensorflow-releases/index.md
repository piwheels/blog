<p>Tensorflow is available for Python 3.7, 3.4 and 3.5 and works on any Raspberry Pi model. Read more in <a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/tensorflow-1-9-officially-supports-the-raspberry-pi-b91669b0aa0">Pete's Medium post</a> and see the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_raspbian">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We're really excited to see what people do with Tensorflow on the Raspberry Pi now that an easy installation is available.</p>
<p>Unlike all other packages on piwheels at present, Tensorflow was not built by the piwheels team. It was built by Google and submitted directly to us for inclusion.</p>
<p>Happy Tensorflowing!</p>
