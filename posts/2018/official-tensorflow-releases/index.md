We're pleased to announce the immediate availability of [Tensorflow
1.9](https://www.piwheels.org/simple/tensorflow/) for Raspberry Pi, as officially supported by the
Tensorflow team at Google.

Install Tensorflow now on your Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo apt install libatlas3-base
sudo pip3 install tensorflow
```

This news was originally announced by Pete Warden, software engineer at Google:

Tensorflow is available for Python 3.7, 3.4 and 3.5 and works on any Raspberry Pi model. Read more
in [Pete's Medium
post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/tensorflow-1-9-officially-supports-the-raspberry-pi-b91669b0aa0)
and see the [official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_raspbian).

We're really excited to see what people do with Tensorflow on the Raspberry Pi now that an easy
installation is available.

Unlike all other packages on piwheels at present, Tensorflow was not built by the piwheels team. It
was built by Google and submitted directly to us for inclusion.

Happy Tensorflowing!
