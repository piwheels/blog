In the period of July â€” September 2019, **2,414,682** packages were downloaded from piwheels,
bringing the total to **11,799,590**. This has saved **29 years** in the period, and **123 years**
in total!

Each month had around 800,000 downloads:

Raspbian still dominates usage with over 94%:

armv7l (Pi 2/3 platform) is still a majority architecture with almost 90% usage, with armv6l (Pi
1/Zero) taking just 8.1%. The combined Arm architecture takes nearly 92% of all usage:

Python version usage changes more over time. As Raspbian Buster was released during the month of
July, Python 3.7 usage quickly overtook Python 3.5:

This was the busiest period for piwheels so far, due to the launch of Pi 4 and Raspbian Buster
(introducing Python 3.7), as detailed in
