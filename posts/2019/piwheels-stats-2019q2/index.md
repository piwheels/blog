Raspbian still dominates usage with over 94%:

armv7l (Pi 2/3 platform) is still a majority architecture with over 88% usage, with armv6l (Pi

Python version usage changes more over time. As Q2 ended before the release of Raspbian Buster
(bringing Python 3.7), Stretch's 3.5 still shows dominance with nearly 3/4 of the share of
downloads, leaving 3.7 trailing behind even 2.7:

This was a reasonably quiet period due to piwheels builders being out-of-action for most of the
period, as detailed in [these](https://blog.piwheels.org/raspbian-buster-builds-in-progress/)
