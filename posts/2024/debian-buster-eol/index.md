<p>Debian Buster was released on <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2019/20190706">6 July 2019</a>, and it's been supported by the Debian team for over five years. On 30 June 2024 it reached its <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases">long term support end of life</a>. Therefore we have stopped building new package releases on Buster, for the cp37m ABI. We will not delete existing cp37m wheels, just not build any new ones.</p>

<p>Now that the sun has set on Buster, we'll return to building for just two ABIs, until next summer when Debian Trixie will be released, and we'll go back up to three.</p>
